        <h1>Why Cybersecurity Matters – The 7 Worst Hacks of 2022</h1>
        <p>A devastating security breach isn’t hard to find these days. Cybercrime is estimated to cost the global
          economy $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, an increase from $3 trillion in 2015. The global Covid-19 pandemic,
          political instability in Ukraine, and the global economic downturn are among the factors contributing to
          cybercrime, Forbes reports.

          <br><br>Due to the constant emergence of new threats, cybersecurity is a growing market. If you’re considering
          a career in cybersecurity, there are plenty of opportunities right now, or in the future.

          <br><br>Here are the seven biggest breaches in 2022, their impact, and what they mean for those considering
          careers in cybersecurity.
        </p>
        <p>No.1 Uber<br>
          Employees at Uber were surprised on September 15, 2022, when they found an unauthorized user posting in their
          company’s Slack channel. Although the suspected hacker was arrested, the damage had been done. The hacker had
          left an explicit image within Uber’s internal systems and exposed how they had hacked the company using social
          engineering.

          <br><br>In another Uber data breach in December 2022, about 77,000 employees’ information was stolen. The
          breach resulted in the theft of a variety of internal company information as well as other internal corporate
          data.

          <br><br>The security investigation concluded that the organization’s system was hacked, with attackers gaining
          access to the critical infrastructure. Hackers also breached Uber’s systems in 2016, gaining access to 57
          million users’ names, email addresses, and phone numbers.

          <br><br>No.2 Medibank<br>
          On October 13, 2022, Australian healthcare and insurance provider Medibank detected some “unusual activity” on
          its internal systems. In October, the malicious party contacted Medibank, attempting to “negotiate with the
          company regarding its alleged removal of customer data“. However, Medibank refused to comply with the hacker’s
          demands publicly.

          <br><br>The malicious hacker gained unauthorized access to and stole 9.7 million customer data from Medibank
          on November 7, revealing the full extent of the security hack. Information on medical procedures and codes
          associated with diagnosis and procedures given included confidential and personally identifying information.
