        <h1>2023’s Most Relevant Machine Learning Trends</h1>
        <p>With 20% of C-level executives reporting that they are using machine learning as a core part of their
          business, it comes as no surprise that the value of the global machine learning market is likely to reach $117
          billion by the end of 2027.

          We’ve scoured the web to round up the seven most talked about machine learning trends. These are our
          predictions for what is going to be the most popular way of developing technology in the foreseeable future
          and what you need to know right now.</p>
        <p>1. Sustainable Technology Growth<br>
          Sustainable and environmentally friendly technology refers to produced or services rendered with an awareness
          of the ethical and environmental costs associated with their creation, usage, and disposal. Organizations will
          continue to look for ways of shifting practices to create sustainable products that reduce a company’s carbon
          footprint by minimizing environmental and ecological risks.
          <br><br>2. Increased AI and Machine Learning
          <br>The benefits of AI and ML are becoming more mainstream and organizations are seeking talent with the
          skills to implement these technologies. According to this recent study organizations expect their investment
          in AI-related talent to increase by 50-100 percent over the next three years.
          <br><br>3. Tiny ML
          <br>According to global tech market advisory firm, ABI Research, a total of 2.5 billion devices are expected
          to be shipped with a Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) chipset in 2030. Over the course of your day, you use Tiny
          ML more than you realize. Tasks like scrolling through your phone, snapping a selfie, checking your email, all
          use machine learning models.

          This method is quickly developing for AI and ML models that use machinery that is hardware-constrained called
          microcontrollers to perform automated tasks. The algorithms are designed to recognize simple commands from our
          voices or gestures.
